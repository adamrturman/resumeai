**A World-Changing Company**

Palantir builds the world’s leading software for data-driven decisions and operations. By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.

**The Role**

Are you passionate about engineering quality, efficiency, and increasing the impact of engineers around you?

Software Engineers at Palantir build software that transforms how the world’s most important organizations use data. As an engineer focused on Frontend Developer Productivity, you’ll work within our Frontend Infrastructure group to identify, develop, and drive investments to improve the velocity and quality of our engineering.

Our frontend infrastructure group covers our entire frontend development stack, from the developer experience in the IDE to the final user experience in the browser. Across the group, we are responsible for developing and maintaining:

• The build and CI system for a large frontend monorepo with millions of lines of code and hundreds of active developers.

• Core infrastructure required to develop and serve our frontends, including feature flags, internationalization, and commit previews.

• A GraphQL API for declarative data loading, spanning many underlying services.

• Blueprint, the [open source UI framework](https://blueprintjs.com/) used by all of Palantir's applications and thousands of developers around the world.

• A variety of tools and VSCode extensions that improve developer experience across the company.

With an ambitious roadmap ahead of us, you'll have the opportunity to make a lasting difference on application development at Palantir.

### Core Responsibilities

- Design tools and infrastructure that make it easy for developers to build performant applications.
- Identify the most pressing issues affecting our frontend developers and advocate for potential solutions.
- Extend our Gradle-based build tooling to decrease build times even as the size of our monorepo increases.
- Provide support for other developers by answering questions on Slack, documenting common dev workflows and issues, or giving internal tech talks.

### Technologies We Use

- A variety of programming languages, including TypeScript, SCSS, and Java.
- Open-source libraries and frameworks like React and GraphQL.
- Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, CircleCI, and GitHub.

### What We Value

- Passion for helping other developers build better applications.
- Empathy for the impact your changes will have on the workflows and productivity of developers and end users.
- Demonstrated ability to design solutions that balance complexity and ongoing maintenance cost against value to the developer and end user.
- Eagerness to delve into the source code of open-source libraries (such Webpack or Chromium) to truly understand how they work or to debug an issue.
- Staying up-to-date with recent industry practices and advancements in open-source technology.
- In-depth knowledge of web technologies and/or build systems is preferred, but not required.

### What We Require

- 2+ years of software engineering experience.
- Strong coding skills, with demonstrated proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C++, Python, or another similar programming language.
- Great problem solving skills with the ability to navigate complex systems.
- Familiarity with data structures, distributed systems, and other technical tools.
- Strong written and verbal communication skills.
