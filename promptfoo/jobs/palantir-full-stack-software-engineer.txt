**A World-Changing Company**

Palantir builds the world’s leading software for data-driven decisions and operations. By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.

**The Role**

Palantir Foundry is an end-to-end platform for data-driven decision-making. We're transforming the way organizations securely integrate their data, so they can then build reliable, critical applications atop that unified foundation. Our customers use Foundry to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organizations. They can also build sophisticated, full-fledged programs, such as common operating pictures, alert-triaging inboxes, and resource allocation planning tools driven by rich-ML models.

As a Full Stack Engineer focused on application development in Foundry, you will be responsible for crafting the tools used by thousands of users to build the sophisticated applications that power their businesses. You will be architecting and developing interfaces, state management and access patterns to support data-intensive workflows that are both powerful and approachable. You may spend one day interviewing users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself considering that customer context along with signal gathered from other customers in different industries, brainstorming approaches to handling intricate UX needs with your teammates.

You’ll regularly be faced with sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, or work with other backend engineers in developing them together.

We’re hiring engineers who are passionate about solving real-world problems and empowering both developers and end-users to work optimally. If you’re motivated to develop reliable, performant, and scalable systems, and to design robust APIs and primitives, this role offers the opportunity to make a significant impact on our products and the people who use them.

**Frontline**

Foundry Software Engineers may be offered the opportunity to Frontline, an exclusive program unlike any other. This unique, short-term assignment involves being embedded with customers, allowing you to work directly with users and gain firsthand insight into how our products are used and the challenges our customers face. Unlike traditional engineering roles, Frontline immerses you in complex, ambiguous problems, empowering you to deliver impactful solutions across some of the world’s most important industries and institutions.

Some of our most successful products were built on the factory floor, addressing real-world problems for the world's most important institutions. These products were developed by some of our most successful product engineers, who began their careers in roles aligned with Frontline responsibilities, gaining a deep understanding of both our technology and our customers.

Frontliners operate across a broad spectrum of responsibilities, much like a startup CTO. They work in small teams to own the end-to-end execution of high-stakes projects. This spectrum ranges from discussing architecture and building custom web apps to conducting workshops with users and strategizing with customer executives. No two days are alike, as each day is diverse and impactful. By witnessing how customers engage with Foundry and experiencing these pain points firsthand, you’ll gain unique insights that feed directly back into our development process, helping to refine and enhance our products. After your frontline rotation is complete, you will return to your regular role where you can apply the experience and understanding you’ve gained.

### Core Responsibilities

- Working as part of a community of engineers building shared frontend tooling to enable teams across Foundry.
- Designing and building for high-scale data intensive APIs (example).
- Developing interactive workflow UIs.
- Building products which aim to make technical concepts accessible for non-technical users.
- Creating low-code/no-code WYSIWYG tools, which enable application builders within Foundry to build products for their users.

### Technologies We Use

- Typescript, React, CSS Modules and GraphQL.
- Palantir maintains Blueprint, and open-source component library, which you will use to build applications.
- A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.
- Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, GitHub, and CircleCI.
- Our build and deployment tooling is owned by an expert, dedicated and friendly frontend infrastructure team that you can collaborate directly with or contribute to, further enhancing our tooling.

### What We Value

- Passion for improving user workflows and building user interfaces that enable users to tackle their problems, while still maintaining engineering quality.
- Ability to work collaboratively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals and understand how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building.
- Skill and comfort working in a constantly evolving environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
- Experience brainstorming and iterating with product designers.
- Experience building high-quality software in a fast-paced CI/CD development environment.
- Proven ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.
- Ability to learn new technology and concepts, even without in-depth experience.
- Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial, but not necessary.

### What We Require

- 2+ years of frontend software engineering experience.
- Strong frontend coding skills used to write clean, effective code, regardless of framework, and existing proficiency in JavaScript and understanding of how web technologies work.
- Familiarity with data structures, loading patterns, frontend frameworks, and other technical tools and concepts.
- Proficiency with programming languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, or similar languages.
- Strong written and verbal communication skills.
