**The Role:**

Neo Financial is looking for a **Senior React Native Developer** to join our mobile team in **Calgary**.

As a Senior Developer, you’ll lead development on our cross-platform mobile applications that power the Neo customer experience. You’ll tackle complex product challenges, mentor other developers, and help shape the future of our mobile architecture. Our mobile stack is built on **React Native, TypeScript, GraphQL**, and native integrations where performance or access to device capabilities requires it.

You’ll work closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-impact features, optimize performance, and ensure a seamless and delightful mobile experience. We’re also accelerating our development velocity using tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**, and internal **AI agents**—and you'll be part of shaping how we build with AI.

**What you'll be doing:**

- Take technical ownership of core areas in our **React Native** codebase across iOS and Android

- Design and build scalable, performant, and elegant mobile features in **TypeScript** and **React Native**

- Lead technical direction for major initiatives, ensuring architectural consistency and performance across platforms

- Write high-quality, testable code and enforce rigorous standards through code reviews

- Help evolve and maintain our design system and component libraries for mobile

- Work closely with backend engineers, designers, and product managers to bring features to life

- Guide adoption of mobile-specific testing practices including **unit, integration,** and **end-to-end testing**(e.g. **Jest, Detox**)

- Analyze and optimize performance using profiling tools and real-world telemetry

- Mentor intermediate and junior developers, sharing knowledge and encouraging continuous improvement

- Push forward mobile CI/CD best practices with tools like **EAS, Fastlane,** or **Bitrise**


**Who we are looking for:**

- **Expert in React Native** and **TypeScript**, with a deep understanding of cross-platform development nuances

- Proven experience building and scaling complex mobile apps for both **iOS and Android**, ideally in a high-growth environment

- Strong grasp of mobile performance optimization, debugging tools, and **native module integration** when needed (Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java)

- Solid experience working with **GraphQL** APIs and managing client-side state

- Bonus for experience with **Expo** (including EAS build and deploy), or managing hybrid codebases

- Strong understanding of **design systems**, **mobile accessibility**, and scalable architecture patterns (e.g. monorepos, modularization)

- Familiarity with **observability tools** like **Sentry**, **Datadog**, or **Firebase Performance Monitoring**

- Experience mentoring other developers and working across teams on large-scale product development

- Passion for AI-assisted development and interest in how it can accelerate engineering work

- 6+ years of professional software development experience, with significant time spent on mobile


\*\*Applicants must be eligible to work in Canada and willing to **relocate to Calgary** — relocation packages and reimbursements are available.
