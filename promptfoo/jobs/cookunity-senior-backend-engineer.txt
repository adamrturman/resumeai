# Senior Backend Engineer - Ops Tech

Engineering

Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina

### About CookUnity:

Food has lost its soul to modern convenience. And with it, it has lost the power to nourish, inspire, and connect us. So in 2018, CookUnity was founded as the first-of-its-kind platform that connects the world with the source of truly great food: chefs. Today, CookUnity delivers 50 million meals a year from the industry’s best chefs to homes all over the country. Fresh. Ready-to-eat. And crafted with the passion that nourishes body and soul.

Unwilling to stop there, CookUnity is expanding beyond delivery to become an ever-innovating marketplace focused on our singular mission: **empower Chefs to nourish the world.**

If that mission has you hungry in more ways than one, you’ve found the right job posting.

### The role:

We are looking for a Senior Engineer to play a key role in building and optimizing our fulfillment and logistics technology.

- Stay ahead of industry trends, continuously seeking opportunities to innovate within fulfillment and logistics tech
